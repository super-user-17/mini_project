# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The implemented system is helpful for everyone in present world for providing contactless sanitizing and body temperature check before taking entry at any place.

## What:

A smart sanitization and alert system with ability to send alerts along with image of person in case of anomaly.

## When:

When taking entry at any public place to ensure that every person take sanitization and body temperature check process seriously to ensure safety of everyone. 

## Where:

Can be put at entry gates of various place like school/colleges, offices, malls, metro stations etc.

## How:

The system automatically dispenses sanitizer when a person takes entry at entry gate 1 and shows instruction to go to entry gate 2. At entry gate 2 body temperature of person is checked. If the person has skipped sanitization or is having signs of fever, it triggers the buzzer to alert nearby people and also an automatic alert is triggered in form of SMS/e-mail along with image of person to report this incident.
